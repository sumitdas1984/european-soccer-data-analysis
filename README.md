# European Soccer Data Analysis

In this repository we analyze games from European Soccer Leagues with apache spark and databricks

Here we explore how to:

* Use Databricks notebooks to simplify your ETL (data engineering).
* Use built-in and third-party visualizations with a notebook to simplify your data analysis.
* Execute ML pipelines in a notebook to predict the number of goals.

## Data
Weâ€™ll use a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/secareanualin/football-events), that provides a granular view of 9,074 games, from the biggest 5 European soccer leagues: England, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France, for the 2011 to 2016 seasons.
